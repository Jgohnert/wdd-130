      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Hi, my name is Joanna Gohnert and I am a web developer looking to create a website for COLUTYMA productions. COLUTYMA is an independent film studio looking to make a name for themselves, which is exactly why I plan to help them by creating a website that will catalogue their movies with brief summaries and character bios to get the audience interested in supporting an aspiring team of talented creators. Wouldn’t it be easier for companies to be able to find talent through a website like this? Wouldn’t you want to be able to find and support small creators with just a few convenient clicks? I hope to do exactly that with the official COLUTYMA website. Please consider supporting me and the talented actors and producers behind COLUTYMA productions.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[Families and movie fans that like supporting smaller film producers are the target audience for this website. This website will serve as a showcase for COLUTYMA productions' numerous works throughout the years, allowing the target audience to better understand the movies, characters, and actors that helped bring these films to life. Overall, we want the material we produce to entertain and delight people so that the platform may continue to develop for many years to come.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
