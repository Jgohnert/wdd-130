                <p>Atticus, the adopted brother and former teammate of Myles Melyne, was also given the Nova serum at birth. Atticus was compatible with the serum and even gained the power of heat vision as a side effect. his undefeated strength helped him rise quickly in rank, eventually earning him the highest position of command in the enhanced soldier corp.</p>
                <p>Vome is an exceptional soldier who harbors a fearsome grudge against Myles. He is well renowned for his lightning abilities as a result of the Nova serum he was given. Vome wears a striking grey mask that helps to keep himself alive after Myles mislead his squad into a trap. He was considered for the position of second in command, but was overruled by Atticus in favor of Myles. After these unfortunate incidents, Vome now awaits the day he can get his revenge against his former comrade Myles.</p>
