        <h2>Joanna Gohnert</h2>
       <p>Hello, my name is Joanna Gohnert. This is my first time being here at BYU-I, and I am majoring in computer science.</p>
       <p>Before I came to study here, I worked with my parents to remodel a cafe in my local small town that was in business for over a hundred years. I worked there as a waitress, cook, washed dishes and delivered food.</p>
       <p>I am the second oldest of three brothers, one serving a mission in San Bernardino California, another is serving in the Alpine Germany Mission, and my other brother is currently saving up for a mission. I am very proud of them and I am excited to see them again when they return.</p>
       <p>I play piano and was the sacrament pianist for several years. I also love drawing, astronomy, watching movies, video games and learning new skills!</p>
       <p>I only just learned the basics of programming last year, and I hope to learn more about computers with you guys during my studies here at BYU-I.</p>
